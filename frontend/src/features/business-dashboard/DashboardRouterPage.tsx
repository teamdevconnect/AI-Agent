// Phase 19 — the business-hierarchy roles (owner/manager/consultant) now all
// render the single Unified Analytics Dashboard (role-scoped internally by
// the backend), replacing the previous three separate OwnerDashboardView/
// ManagerDashboardView/ConsultantDashboardView components. Those files, and
// their backing GET /home-dashboard/{role} + GET /crm/dashboard/{role}
// endpoints, are left completely intact and untouched (not deleted) — this
// is the literal mechanism for the user's own confirmed two-step sequencing
// ("implement the new dashboard first, remove the old ones only later, once
// reviewed and explicitly confirmed"). They simply become unreachable via
// this router the moment it stops calling them, same as this exact route
// swap happened once before in this app's history (Phase 3). Deal
// Performance and Agent Activity are NOT touched by this pass at all —
// both keep their own live routes/nav entries for direct comparison.
// Accounts with no business-hierarchy role (a plain admin or agent_user
// account) keep falling back to the original AI-workforce dashboard.
