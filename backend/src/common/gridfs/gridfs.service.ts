// Extracted from finance-gridfs.service.ts (this codebase's first-ever
// GridFS use) once Business Knowledge became a second real consumer — same
// promotion trigger as MultiSelectDropdown/DateRangeControl's move to
// components/ui/ in Phase 10a. Parameterized by bucket name so each feature
// keeps its own GridFS bucket (finance_documents, business_knowledge_documents,
// ...) while sharing one implementation, mirroring how RedisCacheService is
// instantiated directly in every consuming module's own providers array (no
// CommonModule wrapper exists or is needed in this codebase).
//
// Uses mongoose's own re-exported `mongo` driver classes (mongoose.mongo.*)
// rather than importing the standalone `mongodb` package directly — mongoose
// bundles its own copy of the mongodb driver, and TypeScript treats that as
// a structurally different type from a separately-installed top-level
// `mongodb` package, even at the same version (Connection.db wouldn't be
// assignable to a directly-imported GridFSBucket's constructor param).
// Going through mongoose.mongo guarantees the exact same type identity.
